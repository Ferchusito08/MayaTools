# MayaTools

## Description
A collection of scripts and tools designed to enhance and automate workflows in Maya. This toolkit aims to improve productivity and streamline common tasks.

## Features
- Automation of repetitive tasks  
- Utilities for modelling, animation, rigging, etc 
- Easy integration into your existing pipeline  

## Requirements
- Autodesk Maya 2021+
- Python 3.x (integrated in the software)
- The folder FCL_Tools must be located here: "C:\Users\<your_username>\Documents\maya\scripts\FCL_MayaTools"

## What is this?
This is a custom toolset for Autodesk Maya, called FCL Maya Tools
It adds a dropdown menu to Maya's top bar, giving you quick access to custom scripts

## One-time Installation
To properly install and configure the tool, you must run a script that sets it up inside Maya.

Steps:

- Open the folder where the tool was downloaded
- Double-click the .bat file to launch the installation 
(Path: "C:\Users\<your_username>\Documents\maya\scripts\FCL_MayaTools\executeManually\create_module.bat")
- A terminal window will open and display progress messages
- When you see the message Mod file created at: ..., you’re done.

## What does this script do?
It automatically creates a .mod file inside Maya’s modules folder
That file tells Maya where to find the tool each time it starts

## Using the Tool
Launch Maya and a new menu called FCL_Tools should appear at the top of the interface

Don’t forget to share these tools if you liked them and give me your feedback.
Thanks :D
